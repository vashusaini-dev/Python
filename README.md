## Python Data Types
Python has the following data types built-in by default, in these categories:

- **Text Type:** `str`
- **Numeric Types:** `int`, `float`, `complex`
- **Sequence Types:** `list`, `tuple`, `range`
- **Mapping Type:** `dict`
- **Set Types:** `set`, `frozenset`
- **Boolean Type:** `bool`
- **Binary Types:** `bytes`, `bytearray`, `memoryview`
- **None Type:** `NoneType`

## Python Conditions
Python supports the usual logical conditions from mathematics:

- Equals: `a == b`
- Not Equals: `a != b`
- Less than: `a < b`
- Less than or equal to: `a <= b`
- Greater than: `a > b`
- Greater than or equal to: `a >= b`

These conditions can be used in several ways, most commonly in **if statements** and **loops**.

## Python OOP

### What is OOP?
OOP stands for **Object-Oriented Programming**.

Python is an object-oriented language, allowing you to structure your code using classes and objects for better organization and reusability.

**Advantages of OOP**
- Provides a clear structure to programs
- Makes code easier to maintain, reuse, and debug
- Helps keep your code **DRY** (Don't Repeat Yourself)
- Allows you to build reusable applications with less code

> **Tip:** The DRY principle means you should avoid writing the same code more than once. Move repeated code into functions or classes and reuse it.

### What are Classes and Objects?
Classes and objects are the two core concepts in object-oriented programming.

A **class** defines what an object should look like, and an **object** is created based on that class.  

**Examples:**

| Class  | Objects                |
|--------|------------------------|
| Fruit  | Apple, Banana, Mango   |
| Car    | Volvo, Audi, Toyota    |

When you create an object from a class, it inherits all the variables and functions defined inside that class.
